 * Site-wide structured data, modeled as a connected schema.org @graph so the
 * crawler reads one coherent entity: the Organization, its two North American
 * offices (LocalBusiness nodes wired back via parentOrganization), and the
 * WebSite. This is what establishes TBM in Google's knowledge graph and makes
 * the offices eligible for local results. The FAQ section adds FAQPage schema.
 *
 * Structured addresses are written explicitly here (the display strings in
 * site.ts aren't broken into locality/region/postal), but phones + email are
 * sourced from site.ts so they never drift.
